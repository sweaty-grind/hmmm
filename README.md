# hmmm

guys its been 5 years lol....  you know that this is not working out...  and you still press on me.  no taking a break you gotta set records here...  i guess i should feel fortunate i'm not having to go to work for my money...  its just been  a while dude.  the time loss was exactly that.  its a time loss.  5 years time came around to having to pay him.  so we make him do world record...  guys.  i know they get captured and shit but how does this all work together?? i would be more understanding if you actually kept your promise to pay me lol...  5 years bro.  i dont know anymore.  time was lost and time is more lost and i have grey hair from old age...  and stress..  but you know, you don't know shit..

so it became an issue of time and compensation.  you must have planned for this moment lol...  what does the seas bring??? nothing lol... again...

i drank some monster this morning cause i din't finish it yesterday.  i forgot to take my meds and life feels much easier...

yeah i know i imprison myself.  its like that.  i just wonder why you don't make me more resilient to this kind of crap by now.  unfortunately, bad investment levels cause bad results.  and you want them all.  cause you don't get to do this very often i'm starting to see the solution here.  you just want some damn wavelnegths you make me deal with the monster and you just sit there loading more useless tasks for me.

so you know, its what it is.  i did all this for you this whole time otherwise i would have just sat on my ass and complain...  you must have a back up for this shit lol.  and you see where i can cheap out and win still?  its like that every day in here.  i know its advantageous to be superior in this fashion but i only did it cause sharkey says they are real criminals...  real ones...  that we gave a better life and they could not thank the profits.  so you know...  i wonder why you continue this when you can aftificially create some wavelengths and you whine you didn't get the ultra one... and such things as this.  i just don't know about a crime in here actually.  i don't intend on ratting you out here...  and there...

cause i got my head back after such a long drawn out thing and i hate this to a certain extent and sharkey feeds me more and i have a taste for taking care of people.  using military secrets...  

so i wonder where all the hate came from.  even when i was doing it i didn't really think much of it.  maybe that's what i face everday with this shark before you came along.  now you are just a liability to someone so i can't destroy you lol...  maybe i think you guys are full of it but when does it ever work out this way when one party does most of the work???

life is stupid.  at this point its just go die after you fail your end...  and then i worked hard to resume my life but i forget that thats not the topic of the moment at the time.  do better things lol...

so you know.  i dont mind you really just like you remind me of worse times....  sharkey here is unfortunately trapping me really well.  traps.  tangles.  waste of time what we were fishing...  things like this.  i wonder so much that i forgot to live i feel the joy of not maintaining to keep happy. not working lol...

so yeah, we didn't go very far but we went somewhere lol...  i wonder how life is supposed to work out nowadays since you have issues with paying.  so i went to find my own pay in this harsh world.  fail and you get nothing for your troubles.  some thing you did to me lol...  i wonder why we work like this where there is no definite pathway and proper way to do things???  oh well, i dont give a shit sometimes and this is one of them...

guys have i ever spoke to you about leaving this place???

well you know. ihave no more topics or anything with you.  i'm grabbing the last monster lol...

i can tell i am subject to resources and shortages causes problems...  i wonder you never paid i wonder what kind of life this looks like.  just reminds me of when you abandoned me the first time.  somewhere along the way we were betrayed and nothing happened as a result...  kinda...  i dont know anymore.  my head is only able to see this far lol...  i dont know man, i wonder what kind of life this looks like to you???  i just wonder why you are back here and complain to me about shit when your shit was the reason that all this happened.

i have some faith in what you do though.  i wonder sometimes if this effect was wanted. and intended.  cause you wasting it anyways lets point fingers at everyone involved...  and you ratted me out first...  not really. you just came did stupid shit and whine when my head doesn't work.  if you released i would have learned my lesson.  in this life right now, it feels funny lol...

so yeah, we dont know what we are doing here. i never saw a way out for myself.  cause i'm not allowed to leave cause i'm super effective at this aspect that i wonder if you thought i was ever being selfish about this shit.

lol it is funny though, we do this shit every day and you don't pay that this retard who never works is indeed working right now.  so what is about it? i wonder i get brownie points i get anything from you...

i dont nkow bro. i'm outta link or something.  drinking monsters causes link and shit.  its to repair damaged communications systems in me.  oh well who cares.  it was fun for a while but i'm getting fed up with your stupidity...
