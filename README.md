guys its been 5 years lol....  you know that this is not working out...  and you still press on me.  no taking a break you gotta set records here...  i guess i should feel fortunate i'm not having to go to work for my money...  its just been  a while dude.  the time loss was exactly that.  its a time loss.  5 years time came around to having to pay him.  so we make him do world record...  guys.  i know they get captured and shit but how does this all work together?? i would be more understanding if you actually kept your promise to pay me lol...  5 years bro.  i dont know anymore.  time was lost and time is more lost and i have grey hair from old age...  and stress..  but you know, you don't know shit..

so it became an issue of time and compensation.  you must have planned for this moment lol...  what does the seas bring??? nothing lol... again...

i drank some monster this morning cause i din't finish it yesterday.  i forgot to take my meds and life feels much easier...
