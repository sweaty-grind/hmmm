# hmmm

so its another day bro.  i learned something today.  its called keeping up a hope.  i learned hope was the only thing you ever had that you  never wanted.   lol...  i dont know bro.  i'm sitting on a giant golden egg right now.  so what now????

i made it so i whack you guys if you don't pay lol.  after doing it, i seriously regret i ever knew myself.  you know???  you wanted i provided.  what's so salty these days???

so there is a lot going on in  my simple life and yet i notice these minute details.  and so on and so on.

yeah i learned my brain is severed or something...

lol i just got the workings done to me.  i am overburdened with your debt load you carry all the idiots.  so i sold them insurance.  mandatory insurance lol.  so maybe the point i screwed up here was that i forced it onto you...  you know, you suck up the other aliens why you cry about this.  somethings somethings. i realize that my typings have no more power nowadays but i think its accustomed to typing here.  i wonder what you think of that???  i feel you are working up something stupider and stupider.
